## What this system is for

Eli runs many small projects. The point of this system is to keep them **visually consistent and fast to ship** — drop in the tokens, grab a UI kit, focus on the work. Every artifact in this folder should answer: _"how do I make this Miltinson-branded in 5 minutes?"_

## INDEX

<!-- ds-artifacts:managed:begin -->
<!-- Regenerated on every publish from what the tarball actually contains. Do not edit. -->

| Path                | What's there |
| ------------------- | --- |
| `colors_and_type.css` | The neutral ramp, surfaces, type, spacing, radii, shadow and motion — and the entry point that @imports the three files below. Import this anywhere. |
| `palettes.css`      | The brand ramps and every semantic built on them, on a `data-palette` dial. colors_and_type.css @imports it by this exact name — rename it and the whole system renders greyscale. |
| `mobile.css`        | Radii, the small end of the type ramp, gutter and containers retuned under `data-platform="mobile"`. Declares no token of its own and changes no colour. |
| `fonts.css`         | Self-hosted @font-face for Geist and JetBrains Mono — colors_and_type.css @imports it, so keep them siblings. |
| `fonts/`            | The woff2 files fonts.css loads, with their SIL OFL licenses. |
| `assets/`           | Wordmark, monogram, lockup, dot-grid pattern. SVG-first. |
| `ui_kits/marketing/` | Marketing site kit (homepage, services, store, portfolio). |
| `ui_kits/webapp/`   | Web app / dashboard kit (auth, sidebar, settings). |
| `ui_kits/mobile/`   | Mobile screen kit. |
| `ui_kits/docs/`     | Docs / long-form reading kit. |
| `ui_kits/_shared/`  | JSX primitives every kit loads over `../_shared/Primitives.jsx` — a kit copied without it renders nothing. |
| `README.md`         | Brand voice, color, type, and layout rules. Read this first. |
| `SKILL.md`          | This file — the skill entry point. |

## CONTENT FUNDAMENTALS

How Miltinson copy is written. Read this before writing for the brand.

### Voice

- **Eli speaks as himself.** First person singular: _"I'm Eli Robinson — I build software, teach AI…"_, _"I'll show you what's actually useful, what's hype…"_. Never the royal "we." This is not a company-of-many; it's a human.
- **Reader is "you."** Direct address, no buffer.
- **Confident but unguarded.** _"No jargon, no judgment — just practical solutions."_ The brand admits the field is full of nonsense and explicitly opts out.

### Tone (in order of weight)

1. **Practical** — "no-fluff", "what's actually useful", "saves you real time"
2. **Honest** — calls out hype, "no contracts required", transparent pricing ("From $150/hr")
3. **Warm** — patient, "trusted hand", reassuring about non-technical readers
4. **Quietly confident** — never flexes credentials, lets the work speak

### Casing & punctuation

- **Sentence case** for headings ("Featured Apps", "Coaching Guides", "Need help with AI or tech?"). Never ALL CAPS for body content.
- **Title Case** is reserved for product/proper names ("Kids Recipes", "AI Consulting", "Tech Support") and the tagline ("Builder. Consultant. Founder.").
- **Periods inside the wordmark.** "Miltinson." with a period — it's part of the mark.
- **Em-dashes** as the favored break: _"I'm Eli Robinson — I build software…"_, _"No jargon, no judgment — just practical solutions."_ Use them.
- **Oxford commas:** yes, when present.
- **Pricing always prefixed with "From"** — "From $150/hr". Never list a single firm number; this signals starting point, not ceiling.

### Words to use

build, ship, practical, honest, no-fluff, hands-on, real, useful, trusted, patient, clear, simple, fun, interactive, no contracts, get started, get in touch, follow-up, what's actually useful

### Words to avoid

synergy, leverage, unlock, empower, robust, cutting-edge, revolutionary, world-class, seamless, frictionless, reimagine, AI-powered (used flatly), 10x, ninja, rockstar, "we" (when Eli means "I")

### Emoji

- **Sparingly.** The site uses ✓ as a checklist bullet inside service tier lists. That's it. No 🚀 🎉 ⚡, no decorative emoji in body copy or headings.
- When a small mark is needed (checkmark, arrow), prefer a Lucide SVG icon. ✓ is acceptable as a fallback in plain-text contexts.

### Sample copy snippets (real, from the site — use as anchors)

- _"Builder. Consultant. Founder."_
- _"I'm Eli Robinson — I build software, teach AI, and create resources for coaches."_
- _"Practical, no-fluff guides written for sports coaches."_
- _"Clear, patient tech help for individuals and small businesses who need a trusted hand."_
- _"Tell me what you need and I'll get back to you within 24 hours."_

### Generated taglines (write more in this style)

- "Practical tech, honestly built."
- "Built by hand. Shipped on purpose."
- "Tools that earn their keep."
- "AI help without the hype."

## VISUAL FOUNDATIONS

### Color

- **Ink-led palette.** Pure black (`--ink-1000`) for headings, near-black (`--ink-800`) for primary text. White surfaces, hairline borders. The brand reads as a printed page first, a digital interface second.
- **The brand is a dial.** Amber-over-Forest is the `ember` palette and it is the default, but `data-palette` swaps the ramps and the neutral tint underneath them wholesale. Everything below describes ember; nothing in the system may assume it. Never paint a ramp step (`--signal-500`, `--anchor-500`) in a component — reach for the semantic token (`--accent`, `--accent-ink`, `--anchor`) that follows the dial.
- **Miltinson Amber** (`--signal-500`, oklch 72.5% 0.175 65) is the **only loud color**. Used for: primary CTAs, the dot in the wordmark, eyebrow underlines, key stat figures, and link hover states. Never as a flat background block — it's a signal, not a fill.
- **Miltinson Forest** (`--anchor-500`) is the secondary anchor — used sparingly for trust marks and the Coaching Guides surface (the most "earnest" sub-brand). Not for success states: status owns its own hues (`--status-success` and friends) and does not move with the brand, so a success badge stays green under a palette whose anchor is not.
- **No gradients.** Flat color only. Solid blocks of `--ink-1000` or `--ink-50` are the move.
- **Imagery vibe:** warm, slightly desaturated, real (not stock-y). Think well-lit kitchens, classrooms, hands holding a phone — not abstract gradient meshes.

### Type

- **Geist** (sans) for everything in the UI. Weights used: 400 body, 500 UI labels, 600 headings, 700 display peaks.
- **JetBrains Mono** for: code, eyebrows (uppercase tracked labels), pricing figures, kbd tags, technical metadata.
- **Tracking:** display sizes get `-0.025em` (tight), body is `0`, mono eyebrows get `+0.08em` (open).
- **Line-height:** body 1.65 (relaxed and forgiving — accessibility-first), display 1.05 (tight).
- **Numerics:** mono in tables and pricing. Tabular figures everywhere numbers compare.

### Spacing

- 4px base, 8px-friendly. Use the `--space-*` scale only — no magic numbers.
- **Generous vertical rhythm.** Sections breathe (`--space-13` / 128px gaps between major sections on landing pages).
- **Tight horizontal density** inside cards (`--space-4` / 16px is the default inner padding for compact components).

### Backgrounds

- **Default surface:** white / `--ink-0`. Hero sections invert to `--ink-1000` with white type.
- **Texture:** `assets/pattern-dotgrid.svg` — 8% opacity dots. Use as a hairline overlay on dark heroes only. No repeating gradients, no noise PNGs, no "tech grid" cliché.
- **Full-bleed images** for portfolio cards and product spotlights. Aspect ratios: 16:10 (web), 4:5 (mobile), 1:1 (avatar/store thumb).
- **No glassmorphism.** No frosted blur backgrounds. The brand is honest, not theatrical.

### Borders

- **1px hairlines** as the primary divider. Use `--border` (`--ink-200`) for default, `--border-strong` (`--ink-300`) for emphasized.
- **Borders do the work shadows usually do.** A card is a 1px border on white, not a floating shadow.

### Shadows

- **Restrained scale** (`--shadow-xs` → `--shadow-xl`).
- Default cards: `--shadow-sm` (1px border + 1px tint). That's enough.
- `--shadow-lg`+ for modals only.
- **Inset shadow** (`--shadow-inset`) on input wells.

### Radii

- **Sharp by default** — `--radius-sm` (4px) for buttons, inputs, cards. Tech-forward, not pillowy.
- `--radius-md` (6px) for cards.
- `--radius-lg` (10px) for modals.
- `--radius-pill` reserved for **tags only** (category labels like "Food", "Family", "Education"). Never for CTAs.

### Motion

- **Calm, purposeful.** `--dur-fast` (140ms) for hovers, `--dur-normal` (220ms) for state changes.
- **Easing:** `--ease-out` is the default. `--ease-spring` only for icon micro-interactions (a check mark settling into place).
- **No bouncy page transitions, no parallax.**
- Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` (already wired into `colors_and_type.css`).

### Hover states

- **Buttons:** background steps one shade lighter (`--accent-hover`) — never opacity changes.
- **Links:** color shifts from ink to `--signal-700` (warm dark amber).
- **Cards:** border darkens to `--border-strong`, plus a 1px translateY lift. No scale.

### Press / active states

- **Buttons:** background steps one shade darker (`--accent-press`) and translateY(1px). No scale.
- **Cards/list items:** background tints to `--bg-subtle`.

### Focus

- **High-contrast ink ring** (`outline: 2px solid var(--ink-1000)` with 2px offset). Same on light and dark — accessibility-first. Never amber on amber.

### Transparency / blur

- **Almost never.** The header may use `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` with 92% white when scrolled — that's the only sanctioned blur.
- No translucent panels, no frosted modals.

### Cards

- **White surface, 1px border, 6px radius, 16–24px padding.**
- Optional accent: a 1px amber underline on hover, OR a small uppercase mono eyebrow above the title.
- No left-border accent stripe (this is a clichéd AI-slop pattern — avoid).

### Layout rules

- **Max content width:** 1280px (`--container-xl`). Editorial body copy clamps tighter at 720px (`--container-md`) for readability.
- **Sticky header** (h: 64px). Stays visible.
- **Footer** is pure ink (`--ink-1000`), white type, mono micro-copy.
- **Asymmetric grids** are encouraged. 7–5, 8–4 splits beat 6–6.

### Accessibility (default-on)

- Min body size: **16px**.
- Min touch target: **44×44px**.
- All color combinations pass WCAG AA at minimum (verified amber-on-ink-1000 = 8.7:1; ink-1000-on-amber = same).
- Every interactive element has a visible `:focus-visible` ring.
- Icons paired with text labels in primary nav. Icon-only buttons require `aria-label`.

### Internationalization

- Geist + JetBrains Mono cover Latin, Latin-Ext, Cyrillic, Greek.
- Type sizes use `clamp()` so translations of varying length don't break layouts.
- No hardcoded text in components — copy lives in props/strings.
- LTR-first; RTL is supported via `:dir(rtl)` selectors where needed (icons mirror, never text).

## ICONOGRAPHY

### System

**Lucide** (https://lucide.dev) is the chosen library — clean 1.5px stroke, geometric, friendly without being twee. Loaded via CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest/dist/umd/lucide.min.js"></script>
<script>
  lucide.createIcons();
</script>
```

> **Substitution flag:** the live miltinsons.com site uses `✓` checkmark glyphs in its services list. I haven't seen the codebase, so I don't know if a different icon set is in use there. Lucide is a safe default. If you have a preferred set (Heroicons, Phosphor, hand-drawn), drop it in `assets/icons/` and I'll switch.

### Usage rules

- **Stroke weight:** 1.5px (Lucide default). Don't mix weights in one view.
- **Size:** 16, 20, or 24px. Inline icons match the cap-height of adjacent text.
- **Color:** inherits `currentColor` — never hardcode. Default `--fg-2`, hover `--fg-1`.
- **Pair with labels** in nav and primary actions.
- **One icon per affordance.** Don't stack.

### When emoji is OK

- Sparingly in tags/category chips for the **Kids Recipes** sub-brand (it's playful by design — e.g. 🍳 next to "Breakfast"). Never in headers, body copy, or system UI.
- The check mark (✓) is acceptable in plain-text contexts (email signatures, README bullets).

### Brand assets in `assets/`

- `logo-wordmark.svg` — primary "Miltinson." wordmark (light bg)
- `logo-wordmark-dark.svg` — same, white text (dark bg)
- `logo-mark.svg` — square monogram for app icons / favicons
- `logo-lockup.svg` — wordmark + tagline rule, for footers / signatures
- `pattern-dotgrid.svg` — repeating texture, 8% opacity dots

## SKILL.md

`SKILL.md` at the project root makes this folder usable as a **Claude Code Agent Skill**. Drop the whole project into `.claude/skills/miltinson-design/` in any repo and Claude Code will pick it up.

## Caveats / open questions

- **No codebase or Figma was shared** — this system is reverse-engineered from the public miltinsons.com homepage and services page. The portfolio/store/about pages were not accessible during the fetch.
- **Logo is a generated wordmark.** The real site logo wasn't extracted; I designed "Miltinson." in Geist Semibold with an amber dot. Swap in your real artwork when ready.
- **Geist and JetBrains Mono are self-hosted** — `colors_and_type.css` @imports `fonts.css`, which loads the `.woff2` files in `fonts/` (both families are SIL OFL 1.1; licenses ship alongside). Nothing is fetched from Google Fonts. Keep the three siblings together wherever the stylesheet goes.
